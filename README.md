Snake
====
This is another port of popular snake video game written in Typescript.
If you want to know how to manipulate styles and DOM in typescript, that could be useful.
On the other hand one can see a strong separation between model and views.

One can see working example on http://local.fotolaser.pl/~eldevarth/snake-ts

Same game written in Google Dart lang can be find on https://github.com/grzegorzmoskal/dart

Enjoy!
