Snake
====
This is another port of popular snake video game written in Typescript.
If you want to know how to manipulate styles and DOM in typescript, that could be useful.
On the other hand one can see a strong separation between model and views.

Same game written in Google Dart lang can be find on https://github.com/grzegorzmoskal/DartSnake

You can play on http://local.fotolaser.pl/~eldevarth/snake-ts

Enjoy!
